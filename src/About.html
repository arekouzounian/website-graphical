        <h1> About </h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Arek and I'm a sophomore at USC.</p>
        <p>I'm majoring in Computer Science<!--CS/BA minus the BA-->, and I'm pursuing a minor in Applied Computer Security.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding or learning about new technologies, I spend my time going to the gym, playing D&D, cooking, and exploring LA with my friends.</p>
        <p>I would put more here, but the more I learn about cybersecurity, the less I think that's a good idea! Feel free to reach out to me if you want to learn more about me.</p>
        <!-- And throwing together hacky websites -->
