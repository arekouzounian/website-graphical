                <b><a class="highlight" href="https://github.com/camerondurham/runner">The Runner Project</a></b>
                <br>The goal of this project is to create a 
                remote code execution engine that features a CLI, a 
                website front-end, as well as a REST-based API to run 
                code remotely, akin to 
                <a href="https://play.golang.com/">The Go Playground.</a>

                <b><u>Discord Bots</u></b><br>
                I've worked on/created a series of Discord bots; the one I use most frequently
                of which is <a class="highlight" href="https://github.com/arekouzounian/dnd-bot">dnd-bot</a>, a bot that 
                I created during quarantine to help my home-run D&D game run smoothly in online sessions.
                Another interesting bot that I worked on was a discord bot designed to mimic simplified
                functionality of Reddit, which I worked on during a week-long Discord-run hackathon.

                <b><u>The Aralez Project</u></b><br>
                Throughout the duration of this project, I worked as a backend engineer for a startup 
                focused around building a game in the Unreal Engine. I mainly worked on the templating
                for a basic combat system designed to be used in the Minimum Viable Product, and later 
                was given more managerial responsibilities from my promotion to Lead Engineer. I enjoyed 
                my time on this project, but unfortunately had to leave to focus on schoolwork and other
                pursuits.

                <b><a class="highlight" href="https://github.com/arekouzounian/DataStructures">Data Structures & Foundations</a></b>
                This was less of a project and more of an achievement; throughout all 4 years of high school, I attended
                an extra-curricular programming class on the weekends that was really the gateway into the world of coding 
                for me. I learned the basics of C#, made simple games in the Microsoft XNA framework, made Windows Forms 
                applications, and (linked above, and most intensive of all projects), implemented a number of algorithms and 
                Data Structures<!-- far before I truly understood them -->.
